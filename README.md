The website is about a fictional accounting firm.
There are four pages: home, services, prices, and contact information.
Home and services are pages where I explain, using some fictional information, what the company does. 
On the prices page, I created a table with JavaScript that calculates the 10% discount and the total price of the various services the user can choose from. 
The contact information is on the contact page.
